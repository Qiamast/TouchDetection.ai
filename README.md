# TouchDetection.ai
> TouchDetection.ai is a system that detects instances where AI has been used to create or manipulate multimedia content. This includes identifying deepfake videos, detecting computer-generated text or audio, and identifying images that have been generated by a GAN.

#### Features
- Detects deepfake videos
- Identifies computer-generated text and audio
- Detects images generated by GAN
- Incorporates metadata analysis and watermarking techniques

#### Technical Approach
> TouchDetection.ai uses a combination of techniques to detect AI-generated content. These include:

- Image analysis algorithms to detect patterns or inconsistencies in images
- Machine learning models to analyze audio's spectral characteristics
- Natural language processing techniques to detect patterns in text

#### Installation

> To use TouchDetection.ai, you need to have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. You can then install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Usage
You can use TouchDetection.ai by running the following command:


```Python
python detect.py --input path/to/input_file
```
#### Dataset
A dataset of AI-generated and human-generated content is used to train and evaluate the system.

#### Limitations
While TouchDetection.ai aims to detect AI-generated content with a high degree of accuracy, it may not be able to detect all instances of AI-generated content.

#### Future Work
Future work includes improving the detection of AI-generated text and audio, and incorporating additional techniques for detecting AI-generated content.
